# Numerical Methods in Julia

This repository is a collection of implementations of various numerical methods in Julia programming language. The focus is on providing clear, efficient, and well-documented code in Julia.

## Contents

- **Unconstrained Optimization**: Implementations of various algorithms for optimizing functions without constraints.
  
- **Denoising with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Techniques for reducing noise in data using SVD.
  
- **Subspace Method**: Implementations of methods for analyzing and working in lower-dimensional subspaces.

- **Constrained Optimization** (Coming Soon): Techniques for optimizing functions with specified constraints.
